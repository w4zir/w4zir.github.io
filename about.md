## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the School
of Science and Engineering, LUMS and Lecturer at University of Central Punjab,
Lahore. I am member of the Cyber Physical Networks (CYPHYNETS) research group
supervised by Dr. Abubakr Muhammad. My PhD thesis titled "Vehicle Specific
Road Traversability Analysis" analyze roads for safety by incorporating vehicle
model and graph theoretic approaches on roadmap graphs. His developed system
try to find whether a road is traversable by a vehicle of certain dimensions in
presence of obstacles and how safe the road is compared to some nominal road
with no obstacles.

I have keen interest in Self driving car technology and is looking for new
methodologies and approaches used in self driving cars for navigation and safe
travel. Recently advances in machine learning used for all aspect of robotics
and autonomous driving has really inspired me to look more deeply into this
domain.
